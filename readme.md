## MNIST PyGeNN

Implementation of the paper 'Unsupervised learning of digit recognition using spike-timing-dependent plasticity' by Peter Diehl and Matthew Cook, using the PyGeNN (Python interface of GeNN) SNN framework.

### To Do:
- [x] Create LIF neuron, synapse and STDP weight update models
- [x] Create LIF neuron and synapse populations
- [x] Load and prepare MNIST data
- [x] Create Poisson input model and input population with variable frequency
- [x] Write simulation code
- [x] Add training and classification code
- [ ] Obtain results and plot accuracies
